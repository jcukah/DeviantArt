  <h1>1.Comissions</h1>
    <p>Uploading artwork isnt theonly thing yo can do in DA. You can make money by
    having your followers pay you for art pieces; n top of that, you set the price
    however high you want.This depends wether you do a sketch, lineart or colored piece.</p>
  
   <h2>2.interactions</h2>
  <p>Deviantart is also place that also allows socializing.The best way o that is emailing
    another deviant using his/or her username.</p>
